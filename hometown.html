<h1>Where I Come From</h1> <h2>Dunstable, Massachusetts</h2>



<table> <th> <i> -I grew up in a very small farm town in Massachusetts
called Dunstable.  Dunstable is about 45 minutes to an hour Northwest of
Boston and has a small population of just under 3,000 people. <i/> </tr>

<table> </tr>

<table> <th> <i> -Being such a small farm town, Dunstable quite literally
has more livestock than people!  </i> </tr>

<table> </tr>

<table> <th> <i> -Because Dunstable is so small there really was never a
whole lot to do growing up but my friends and I always found a way to
pass the time by doing things like snowmobiling, off-roading in our
trucks, and fishing.  </i> </tr>

<table> </tr>

<table> <th> <i> -Take a look at the photos down below to get an idea of
what my hometown looks like as well as what my friends and I did for
fun.  </i> </tr>
